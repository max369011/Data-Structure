My name is David Cho. I am 67 years old and I live in New Jersey.

I've been reading this book called 1984 by George Orwell.

This book is truly a masterpiece. I have never read anything like this before.

My 11 year old granddaughter, who resemble my 48.6 year old daughter, seems to be fond of the book as well.
